## 1. Do the following define operations on the given set? Why or why not? (Your answers only need to be a sentance or two; if these do define operations, you do not need to check if they're commutative, associatve, ect. in this problem.)

### (a) $a*b=4a-b$ on $\mathbb{Z}$

### (b) $a*b=3^b$ on $\mathbb{Q}$

### (c) $a*b=\frac{a}{ab+2}$ on $\mathbb{R}$

### (d) $a*b=\frac{1}{ab+2}$ on $\mathbb{R}^+$

## 2. Define an operation * on $\mathbb{R}$ by $a*b=3a-4b+2$

### (a) Is * commutative?

### (b) Is * associative?

### (c) Is there an identity element $e\in \mathbb{R}$ w.r.t. *?

### (d) Does every element $a\in\mathbb{R}$ have an inverse w.r.t. *?

## 3. Define an operation * on $\mathbb{R}$ by $a*b=a+b-ab$. 

### (a) Is * commutative?

### (b) Is * associative?

### (c) Is there an identity element $e\in \mathbb{R}$ w.r.t. *?

### (d) Does every element $a\in\mathbb{R}$ have an inverse w.r.t. *?

## 4. Define an operation * on the set $G=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}|x\ne 0\}$ by $$(a,b)*(c,d)=(ac,ad+bc).$$ Prove that $\langle G,*\rangle$ is an abelian group. (You do not need to check associativity. We will show this in class.)

## 5. Let a,b,c,x be elements of a group G. Solve the following system of equations for x : 

### (a) $bx^2=ax^{-1}\quad$ and $x^4=c$

### (b) $x^2c=bxa^{-1}\quad$ and $xca=cax$

## 6. This problem asks you to consider the importance of using proper notation for inverses in groups. Your answer only needs to be a sentence or two. 
## Suppose a,b, and x are elements of a _nonabelian_ group G, and that we want to solve thte equation $ax=b$ for x. Why would it be incorrect and unclear to say that the solution is $x=\frac{b}{a}$
