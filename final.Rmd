## **Ch. 11 Cyclic Groups** 

The $\underline{\text{cyclic group generated by a }}$ is $\langle a\rangle =\{...,a^{-2},a^{-1},e,a,a^2,...\}$. 

If ord$(a)=n<\infty$ (this means $a^n=e$ and none of $a,a^2,a^3,...,a^{n-1}$ equal e), then $\langle a\rangle=\{e,a,a^2,...,a^{n-1}\}$. 

### Theorem 1:

(a) Every cyclic group of size $n<\infty$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$.

(b) Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. 

Proof: 

(a) Let $G=\langle a\rangle =\{e,a,a^2,...,a^{n-1}\}$ be a cyclic group. 

This function $f:G\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_n$ defined by $f(a^i)=i$ is an isomorphism. 

(b) The same function works here. 

### Theorem 2: 

Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. 

Proof: 

Let $G=\langle a\rangle$ be cyclic. Let H be a subgroup of G. If $H=\{e\}$, then $H=\langle e\rangle$ is cyclic. So assume $H\ne \{e\}$. 

$\underline{\text{Claim}}$: H is generated by $a^m$, where m is the least positive exponent appearing in H. 

We'll show $H=\langle a^m\rangle$ by showing $\langle a^m\rangle \subseteq H$ and $H\subseteq\langle a^m\rangle$. 

Take any element $g\in \langle a^m\rangle$. Then $g=(a^m)^k$ for some $k\in \mathbb{Z}$. Since $a^m\in H$, any power of $a^m$ is in H (since H is a subgroup). Hence, $g=(a^m)^k\in H$, proving $\langle a\rangle\subseteq H$. 

Now we'll show $H\subseteq\langle a^m\rangle$. Take any $h\in H$. Then $h=a^t$ for some $t\in\mathbb{Z}$. 

By the Division Algorithm $\exists$ $g,r\in\mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $$\frac{t}{m}=q+\frac{r}{m}\quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad0\leq\frac{r}{m}\leq 1$$

$$\Rightarrow t=mq+r\quad\quad\text{and}\quad\quad0\leq r\leq m$$

$$\Rightarrow h=a^t=a^{mq+r}=(a^m)^qa^r\quad\quad\quad$$

Now solve for $a^r$: 

$$h=(a^m)^qa^r\quad\Rightarrow \quad a^r=(a^m)^{-q}h$$

($a^m$ is in H, and so is h)

$\Rightarrow a^r\in H$

We chose $a^m$ to be the element of H with the least positive exponent. We just showed that $a^r\in H$. Since $0\leq r<m$, it must be the case that $r=0$. 

Hence, $h=a^t=a^{mq}=(a^m)^q\in \langle a\rangle$, implying $H\subseteq\langle a\rangle$. 

Putting this all together, $H=\langle a\rangle$ is cyclic. 

### Ex. List all subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_6$

List all subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_6=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$: 

1. $\langle 0\rangle =\{0\}$

2. $\langle 1\rangle =\mathbb{Z}_6$

3. $\langle 2\rangle =\{0,2,4\}$

4. $\langle 3\rangle =\{0,3\}$

5. $\langle 4\rangle =\{0,2,4\}$

6. $\langle 5\rangle =\mathbb{Z}_6$

### Facts about cyclic groups:

Let $G=\langle a\rangle=\{e,a,a^2,a^3,...,a^{n-1}\}$ be a cyclic group of size n. 

1. G is abelian (Since $a^ia^j=a^{i+j}=a^{j}a^{i}$)

2. Let $k\geq 1$ be a positive divisor of $|G|=n$. Then G has exactly one subgroup of size k. 

3. The subgroup of G of size 1 is $\langle e\rangle =\{e\}$. If $k>1$ is a divisro of n, the subgorup of size k is $\langle a^{n/k}\rangle$

### Ex. List subgroups of $G_{12}$

Let $G=\langle a\rangle=\{e,a,a^2,a^3,...,a^{n-1}\}$ be a cyclic group of size 12. List the subgroups of G

### Theorem: Size and Order of Cyclic groups

A group of size n is cyclic if and only if it has an element of order n. 

$\underline{\text{Proof}}$ ($\Rightarrow$) let $G=\langle a\rangle$ be a cyclic group of size n. The generator, a, must have order n. 

($\Leftarrow$) let G be a group of size n. let $b\in G$ have order n. 

Then the elements $e,b,b^2,b^3,...,b^{n-1}$ are distinct. Since all elements are in G and $|G|=n$, it must be the case that $G=\{e,b,b^2,...,b^{n-1}\}$, i.e. G is cyclic. $\square$

### Ex. Show $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_3\cong\mathbb{Z}_6$

By theorem 1, we just need to show that $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_3$ is cyclic. By theorem above, we just need to show $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_3$ has an element of order 6. 

I claim that $(1,1)\in\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_3$ has order 6. 

![](img/img67.png)

"how many 1's do you need to add to get zero in the first group? (2) in the second group? (3), then the lcm of 2 and 3 is 6."

Hence $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_3=\langle (1,1)\rangle$ is cyclic, proving $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_3\cong \mathbb{Z}_6$. 

### Ex. $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4\ncong\mathbb{Z}_8$? 

Let's see that $(1,1)\in\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ doesn't have order 8: 

![](img/img68.png)

Thus, $\langle (1,1)\rangle$ has only 4 elements, not 8. 

### Th. Greatest Common Divisor

$\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n\cong \mathbb{Z}_{mn}$ if and only if the greatest common divisor of m and n is 1. 

### Ex. What other elements of cyclic group size 8 (G) are generators of G

Let $G=\langle a\rangle=\{e,a,a^2,a^3,...,a^7\}$ be a cyclic group of size 8. What other elements of G are generators of G?

![](img/img69.png)

Fact: The other generators of G are $a^3$, $a^5$, and $a^7$. This is because their greatest common divisor with 8 is 1.

## **Ch.11 Cyclic Groups** 

On Monday we showed: 

1. A group of size $n<\infty$ is cyclic (and therefore isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$) if and only if it has an element of order n. 

2. Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. If G is a cyclic group of size n, G has exactly one subgroup of size k for each positive divisor k of n. The subgroup of size k is generated by an element of order k. 

### Ex. $A_3\cong\mathbb{Z}_3$

Recall $A_3$ is the group of even permutations in $S_3$: $$A_3=\{\epsilon , (123), (132)\}.$$ 

"only even permutations so switching one element with another wont work. Only "forward" 1 - 2 - 3 and "backwards" 1 - 3 - 2."

Show $A_3\cong \mathbb{Z}_3$. We just need to find an element in $A_3$ with order 3. Since the order of a cycle is equal to its length, ord((123))=$\epsilon$. So, $$A_3=\langle (123)\rangle\quad\quad\Rightarrow\quad\quad A_3\cong \mathbb{Z}_3$$

### Ex. List the subgroups of $A_3$

There will be exactly one subgroup of size k for each positive divisor k of 3. Since the positive divisors of 3 are 1 and 3, the only subgroups of $A_3$ are

(one question like this on homework 4)

Note: it doesn't matter where you start, because 312 represents the same cyclic group as 123. 

## **Ch.12 Partitions and Equivalence Relations** 

Let A be a nonempty set. A $\underline{\text{partition}}$ of A is a collection of nonempty subsets of A $$\{A_i|i\in I\}$$ such that 

(i) distinct subsets $A_i$ and $A_j$ don't overlap (i.e. [for a proof show] if $A_i$ and $A_j$ have an element in common, then $A_i=A_j$. "the only way these two overlap is if they are the same to begin with")

(ii) $\underset{i\in I}U$ (i.e. every element of A is in one of the subsets $A_i$)

(think of little "i's" as labels)

Example: think of coins in a jar. Pennies and nickles wont overlap but they are all still in the jar. (check the book)

### Ex. Partitions of $\mathbb{Z}$

1. $\{2\mathbb{Z},2\mathbb{Z}+1\}$ (even integers, odd integers)

2. $\{3\mathbb{Z},3\mathbb{Z}+1,3\mathbb{Z}+2\}$

$\quad\quad\quad 3\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-6,-3,0,3,6,9,...\}$

$\quad\quad\quad 3\mathbb{Z}+1=\{...,-5,-2,1,4,7,10,...\}$

$\quad\quad\quad 3\mathbb{Z}+2=\{...,-4,-1,2,5,8,11,...\}$

3. $\{A_0,A_1\}$, where 

$\quad\quad\quad A_0=\{n\in\mathbb{Z}|n\text{ is prime}\}=\{2,3,4,7,11\}$

$\quad\quad\quad A_1=\{n\in\mathbb{Z}|\text{ n isn't prime}\}$

### Ex. Partitions the elements of $S_3=\{\epsilon, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)\}$

$\{A_3,A_3(12)\}$ (even permutations, odd permutations)

where $A_3=\{\epsilon, (123), (132)\}$

$A_3(12)=\{\epsilon(12),(123)(12), (132)(12)\}=\{(12),(13),(23)\}$

"stick a (12) on the right"

A (binary) $\underline{\text{relation}}$ on a set A is a statement that is either true or false for each pair $(x,y)\in A\times A$. 

### Ex "$x<y$" is a relation on $\mathbb{Z}$

This is true for $(2,5)$ since $2<5$, but is false for $(10,-6)$ since $10\nless -6$. 

### Ex "x=y" is a relation on $\mathbb{Z}$

This is true for $(3,3)$ since $3=3$, but false for $(1,7)$ since $1\ne 7$.

### Equivalence relation: $\sim$

This textbook uses the sumbol $\sim$ to denote a relation on A that satisfies the following: 

1. Reflexively: For all $a\in A$, $a\sim a$. (Would say that A is relexive if "a is equivalent to itself".)

2. Symmetry: If $a\sim b$, then $b\sim a$. 

3. Transitivity: If $a\sim b$ and $b\sim c$, then $a\sim c$.

A relation $\sim$ that satisfies these 3 properties is called an $\underline{\text{equivalence relation}}$. If $a\sim b$, we say "a is equivalent to b."

### Ex. "="

The relation = is an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Z}$. 

### Ex. "<"

The relation < is $\underline{\text{not}}$ an equivalence relation since its not reflexive or symmetric. ($a\nless a$ and, for example, $1<2$ but $2\nless 1$.)

### Equivalence class

Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on A. The $\underline{\text{equivalence class}}$ of $a\in A$ is the set $$[a]=\{x\in A|x\sim a\}$$ 

note: a is the set of all elements that are equivalent to a. 

### Ex. Define $\sim$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ by $a\sim b$ if and only if $a-b$ is a multiple of 3. 

For example, $7\sim 4$ since $7-4=3$. Similarly, $7\sim -8$ since $7-(-8)=15=3\cdot 5$. 

Let's show $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. 

1. For all $a\in\mathbb{Z}$, $a\sim a$ because $a-a=0=3\cdot 0$. 

2. Suppose that $a\sim b$. Then $a-b=3n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ multiplying by -1 gives $$b-a=-3n=3(-n)\quad\Rightarrow b\sim a$$

3. Suppose that $a\sim b$ and $b\sim c$. Then $a-b=3n$ and $b-c=3m$ for some $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Adding these equations (b's will cancel) gives $$a-c=3n+3m=3(n+m)\quad\quad\Rightarrow a\sim c.$$

So $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Z}$. List the equivalnece classes. 

\begin{equation}\label{D19.0}
\begin{split}
[0] &= \{a\in\mathbb{Z}|a\sim 0\}\\
&= \{a\in\mathbb{Z}|a-0\text{ is a multiple of 3}\}\\
&= \{...,-6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9,...\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{D19.1}
\begin{split}
[1] &= \{a\in\mathbb{Z}|a\sim 1\}\\
&= \{a\in\mathbb{Z}|a-1\text{ is a multiple of 3}\}\\
&= \{a\in\mathbb{Z}|a\text{ is a multiple of 3 plus 1}\}\\
&= \{...,-5, -2, 1, 4, 7, 10,...\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{D19.2}
\begin{split}
[2] &= \{a\in\mathbb{Z}|a\sim 2\}\\
&= \{a\in\mathbb{Z}|a-2\text{ is a multiple of 3}\}\\
&= \{...,-4, -1, 2, 5, 8, 11,...\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

"the list for [2] can be taken from [1], but add two"

So, $\{[0],[1],[2]\}$ is a partition of $\mathbb{Z}$. (It's the same as the example $\{3\mathbb{Z}, 3\mathbb{Z}+1,3\mathbb{Z}+2\}$ from earlier.)

Note: Mathematicians don't like to say "sets of sets", so say "collection of sets instead". 

Note: [3] = [0], and [1] = [4], and so on
